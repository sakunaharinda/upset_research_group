Sakuna Harinda Jayasundara is a second year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Auckland. He received his bachelor's honours degree in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. Based on his academic achievements, he was awarded the ESET Chilisoft Scholarship in 2022. 

Currently, Sakuna is conducting research on utilizing the power of large language models to translate high-level requirements of organizations into machine-executable access control policies. By doing so he intends to improve the reliability as well as usability of access control policy configuration process, which will help avoid access control failures and, in turn, reduce data breaches in the future.
